### SIMPOL project (2013 - 2016)
Since December 2014 I am working on the EU Funded FET FP7 [SIMPOL project](http://www.simpolproject.eu/) (Financial Systems **SIM**ulation and **POL**icy Modelling) as a postdoctoral researcher in the research group led by [Antoine Mandel](https://sites.google.com/site/antoinedavidmandel) at [Centre d'économie de la Sorbonne](http://centredeconomiesorbonne.univ-paris1.fr), [Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne](http://www.univ-paris1.fr/) in Paris, France.

#### Project Objectives
1. Develop new-generation models of financial networks incorporating complex financial instruments that are prone to generate unforeseen systemic effect
2. Provide new tools to quantify gains in the accuracy of risk estimation from future regulations and information disclosures, in particular with respect to non-conventional banking
3. Identify key actors and instruments to contribute to the design of a more sustainable climate-financial system.
4. Develop an ICT knowledge sharing platform to enable the crowd-sourcing of data collection and data analysis regarding policy-relevant socio-economic networks.
5. Develop an ICT infrastructure to gather semantic web data for policy relevant socio-economic networks.
6. Demonstrate the possibility to empower citizens by enabling real-time collective mapping of networks of influence in policy making processes.

My research contributes mainly to the activities in work packages WP2 and WP3 of this project, which are defined in the following way:

**WP2 – Modelling Climate Finance Policies.** We want to analyse the interactions among the various actors and instruments involved in climate finance. Since climate change is a paradigmatic case of global issue with planetary scale and a long-term temporal horizon, the nexus Finance-Climate is a paramount challenge in policy modelling. Moreover, the complexity of financial innovations often hampers the transparency that is needed in climate related agreements. In this respect, we aim to develop network models of climate finance that incorporate financial instruments not taken into account to far. We also develop macro models of climate finance and models of networks of influence revolving around climate-finance policies.

**WP3 – Collective Mapping of Influence Networks.** We build empirical socio-economic networks from a large variety of resources available. Because the sustainability of the financial system is a societal issue, the input of civic society cannot be neglected. The aim of this WP is to demonstrate the feasibility empowering citizens and increase decision-making transparency around financial regulations. It is not necessary to engage civic society in the discussion of the details of policies and their effects. Instead, it is possible and socially desirable to involve civic society in uncovering the network economic interests revolving around policies. To avoid cold-start problems, we follow a mixed strategy whereby we both engage users (with the incentive that they can in exchange gain privileged access to the platform) and we mine existing open datasets. To this end, we will first develop a simple infrastructure, based on the semantic web, to construct, visualize, explore and extend the networks. The networks will be initially constructed by crawling public, open data on the web. Next, the interested public will be able to explore and contribute partial data. This will be used to construct new economic networks and to enrich those that already exist in the database. In this WP, we will also monitor streams of big data ranging from news to financial blogs and social media (such as Twitter) to extract and aggregate the public pulse about socio-economic issues, thus providing additional links and properties to the networks.
